Flight delay prediction is a project aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a flight being delayed. The project involves collecting historical flight data such as departure and arrival times, weather conditions, airline information, and other relevant factors that can impact a flight's performance.

The collected data is pre-processed to clean and transform it into a format suitable for analysis. The pre-processed data is then used to train a machine learning model using algorithms such as decision trees. The trained model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

The project's objective is to develop a model that can accurately predict flight delays and provide insights into the key factors that influence flight delays. The model can be used by airlines, airport authorities, and passengers to plan their travel better and reduce the impact of flight delays. Additionally, the model can help airlines optimize their flight schedules and allocate resources more efficiently.
